# csesoc-edu-wz-starter-discord-bot
A bit of starter code to help with creating your own Discord Bot :)

Create a `.env` file to store your token from Discord.

This starting code was heavily inspired from https://sabe.io/tutorials/how-to-build-discord-bot-typescript

You will need to be familiar with your terminal and a bit of Typescript/Javasccript.
